Development log file 

# 19.05.05
 - Design stereo tracker

# 19.05.07
 - topic names in *.launch file using remap
 - creates synchronized stereo image callback using message_filter

# 19.05.09
 - Stereo tracker without RANSAC completed
 - rviz.launch file created

# 19.05.10
 - Stereo tracker finished !
 - right features are stacked on the left one, that is:
   pointclouldPtr->points : left, right
   therefore, points.size() = 2*ids.size() always

# 19.05.10

# 24.08.04
 - 'Event-frame-inertial odometry using point and line features' algorithm implementation finished !
 - Event processing, Coarse-to-fine motion compensation, Event line detection and tracking, Adaptive event accumulation
 - MSCKF using point and line features (line feature Jacobians calculation, line feature triangulation parts added)

 # 24.11.29
 - Time-consumption calculation code for real-time analysis added

 # 25.01.07
 - Code style refactoring
